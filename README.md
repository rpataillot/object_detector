#object_detector

object_detector is a program allowing to detect and localize object on a video using the YoloV3 model.
As this model as been trained on the coco dataset, the model can only detect class from this dataset.
You can find the complete list of the detetable classes in the file resources/coco.names.

## Installation

1) Create a virtualenv (optional)
Dependencies will be installed on a isolated Python environment which is often recommanded.
```bash
cd object_detector
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv # install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv # Create virtual env called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate # Activate virtual env
pip install --upgrade pip # Upgrade pip
cd ..
```

2) Install requirements
```bash
cd object_detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Download Yolo weights in resources/ folder
```bash
wget -O resources/yolov3.weights https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights # Download yolo weights
```

## Usage

```bash
python detect_objects.py -i <PATH_TO_INPUT_VIDEO> -c person
```

## Detect objects of multiple classes

Yolo can detect is not limited to detect objects of one class. You can detect as much classes as you want with the -c
argument.

Example:
```bash
python detect_objects.py -i <PATH_TO_INPUT_VIDEO> -c person -c car
```

## Generated video path
A video in avi format will be generate in the folder detect_objects/generated.

example to detect person in a video and draw box around them:
```bash
python detect_objects.py -i /mypath/myvideo.mp4 -c person
```

The ouptut file path will be:
detect_objects/generated/myvideo_yolo_processed.avi

## Optional arguments:

        -d --display-class-name: Display the class name of each detected object. Default False

        -t --detection-threshold: Confidence threshold above which an object should be localized in the video. Default 0.5

## Editing config file

The file resources/config.json can be edited as follow:

detection_threshold: the confidence threshold above which an object will be detected
default_detected_class: the default class detected by the program
